# SEO

* Lighthouse scores for Search Engine Optimasation are 100% throughout all pages.

* Furthermore, I created a `slug` for each book, based on their titles, that makes the book discoverable by search engines when someone is searching for the book's title. This approach will increase the site's traffic and increases potential revenue.
